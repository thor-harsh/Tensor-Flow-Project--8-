**In this project we'll be applying Transfer Learning to solve very famous Food Vision 101 challenge of Image Classification using 100% percent i.e whole Food 101 dataset** <br></br>

**Let's looks into dataset:** <br></br>

**About Dataset**: <br></br>
This dataset consists of 101 food categories, with 101'000 images. For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. On purpose, the training images were not cleaned, and thus still contain some amount of noise. This comes mostly in the form of intense colors and sometimes wrong labels. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels. Here I will be taking 10 percent of each classes where total classes is 10 for training and for training the number of images are same as it is in the dataset.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand what is TensorFlow and What do you mean by Transfer Learning, What is Classification problem and What do we actually understand by Feature Extraction and Fine Tuned Transfer Learning?**...<br></br>

**What is a TensorFlow?** <br></br>

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. <br></br>

**What is a Transfer Learning?** <br></br>

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique in which knowledge gained through one task or dataset is used to improve model performance on another related task and/or different dataset. <br></br>

**What is a Classification?** <br></br>

Classification is a supervised machine learning process of categorizing a given set of input data into classes based on one or more variables. <br></br>

**What is a Feature Extractor Transfer Learning?** <br></br>
It Uses the representations learned by a previous network to extract meaningful features from new samples.<br></br>

**What is a Fine Tuned Transfer Learning?** <br></br>
Fine-tuning is a type of transfer learning. It involves taking a pre-trained model, which has been trained on a large dataset for a general task such as image recognition or natural language understanding and making minor adjustments to its internal parameters.<br></br>
